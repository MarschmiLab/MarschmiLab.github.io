## Microbial Ecology & Evolution in Aquatic Ecosystems 

Throughout the world aquatic ecosystems are warming, acidifying, decreasing in oxygen, and eutrophying; however, we have a very limited understanding about the evolutionary potential and adaptability of aquatic microbes to such environmental changes. Our lab investigates the general microbial ecology & evolution of these ecosystems. We also have a special interest in bacterial communities within particulate matter, which may be a major source of genetic innovation and resilience in aquatic microbial communities. These particulate matter microhabitats may serve as hotspots for microbial diversity & interactions, horizontal gene transfer, and genomic diversity. 

To approach these topics, we use a combiation of field sampling, molecular lab methods, and bioinformatic workflows. 

Cornell is an ideal place for experimental and field work within freshwater ecosystems because it is located in the Great Lakes watershed and within the Finger Lakes region. There are also wonderful resources nearby including the <a href="https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/content/cornell-experimental-ponds-facility">Cornell Experimental Ponds</a>, the<a href="https://cbfs.dnr.cornell.edu/">Cornell Biological Field Station at Shackelton Point</a> on Oneida Lake, and the <a href="http://www2.dnr.cornell.edu/cek7/Field%20Station.html">Little Moose Field Station</a> in the Adirondacks! Marian is excited to develop projects across these ecosystems to tests questions in the fields of microbial ecology and evolution!


#### Microbial Biodiversity & Community Structure
We investigate patterns of bacterial biodiversity across environmental gradients in aquatic ecosystems and how variations in diversity may influence bacterial productivity. 


#### Bacterial (Meta)genomics 
One thing that makes bacteria so incredible to study are their dynamic and innovative genomes! This is also true for the genomes of aquatic bacteria. We are interested in understanding how the surrounding community and environment influence genome size, architecture, and selection acting on the genes within these genomes.
