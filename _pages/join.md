*Thank you so much for your interest in our lab! We love talking to prospective students and postdocs. If you're still interested in our work after reading this page, please don't hesistate and get in touch by emailing Marian.*

<h4 style="color:#8E0703;">Cornell undergraduate Students</h4>

We are looking for passionate and motivated undergraduate researchers. Projects in the lab are focused on the bacterial diversity, activity, and genome dynamics of freshwater bacterial communities. We use a combination of field work, molecular methods, and computational tools to approach our research. 

Undergraduates at any stage of their career are encouraged to get in touch with Marian. First and second year undergraduates are especially encouraged so they can have more time to develop their scientific skillset and grow independence in the lab. 

If you're interested in an <a href="https://biology.cornell.edu/research/honors/">undergraduate honors thesis,</a> please email Marian. Honors thesis students are encouraged to work in the lab full time during the summer of their junior year to have more time to delve into their thesis work and to allow more development of their project into a manuscript submission for publication in a scientific journal.


#### Non-Cornell Undergraduate Students

Our lab participates in the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded <a href="https://cihmid.cornell.edu/academics-programs/undergraduate-programs/mff-reu-microbial-friends-foes-research-experience-for-undergraduates-non-cu-students/microbial-friends-foes-research-experiences-for-undergraduates-application/">Microbial Friends and Foes Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Progam.</a>

<h4 style="color:#8E0703;">Cornell Graduate Students</h4>

Our lab is accepting rotation students through the <a href="https://micro.cornell.edu/academics/graduate">Cornell Microbiology PhD Program.</a>  

If you're in another program, please do not hesitate to reach out! Marian can serve on PhD committees across campus. 


#### Prospective PhD Students

Currently, PhD students enter the lab through the <a href="https://micro.cornell.edu/academics/graduate/admissions">Cornell Microbiology PhD Program</a>, which has an annual application deadline of **December 1st** and guarantees 5 years of research funding (mostly through lab grant funding and teaching assistantships (TAs). If you are interested in our lab or the PhD program, please be welcome to reach out via email to Marian at *any* time of year. The most convenient time of year is September-November but it is always better to communicate at any point than never at all!

#### Funding Ideas for Graduate Students

Students in the Cornell Microbiolgy PhD program are guaranteed 5 years of funding, however, it is very affirming and motivating to obtain your own funding. Students in the lab are supported and encouraged to apply to their own funding. Here, we list some ideas below:


- Opportunities outside of Cornell:
	- Due August until mid-October: <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a>.  
	- Due mid-January: <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.</a>
	- Ford Foundation:
