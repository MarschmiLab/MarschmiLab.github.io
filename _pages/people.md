           Marian or Mar <em>(they/them)</em> grew up on Lake St. Clair, the lake that connects Lake Huron to Lake Erie, where they developed a curiosity of aquatic ecosystems and the Great Lakes. After attending Hampshire college, where they surprisingly designed a "major" in environmental microbiology, they fell in love with the world's tiniest organisms: bacteria. Marian's research interests are in microbial ecology, evolution, genomics, limnology and bioinformatics. In their spare time, they like to run far on the "gorges" trails of Ithaca, bake sweet treats (especially granola), and spend time with the Lab dog, Walli. Marian once swam from Asia to Europe across the Bosphorus above thousands of jellyfish and their mom!<br>

           Evie <em>(she/her)</em> is a Postdoctoral Associate at the New York State Water Resources Institute working in collaboration with the Schmidt Aquatic Microbiology Lab. She grew up on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain, where she first became interested in freshwater ecosystems. After attending St. Lawrence University for her B.S and then Clarkson University for her M.S. and PhD studying mercury mobilization along the Upper St. Lawrence River, she developed a fascination with much larger lakes, the Great Lakes. Evie considers herself a contaminant ecologist, with research interests in contaminants (esp. mercury), the Great Lakes, wetlands, limnology, and microbial ecology. In her free time, Evie likes to run, read, bake, and explore outdoors

        <h3>Evelyn Martinez</h3>
           <p>Cornell NSF Microbial Friends & Foes REU Summer Researcher<br>

           Evelyn <em>(she/her)</em> is a Microbial Friends and Foes REU student in the lab during the summer of 2023. She is a rising senior at the University of Tampa pursuing a bachelors degree in Biology (Molecular Biology concentration). Her research interests include aquatic microbiology, virology, and microbial pathogenesis. Evelyn's fascination with aquatic microbiology stems from her trips to Ecuador (where her family is from) and seeing the many lakes found in the Andes mountains. At her home institution, Evelyn is conducting research in identifying uncharacterized bacteria from recreational water sites in Tampa Bay. This summer, she will help with field work in the lab and analyze how oysters impact marine sediment microbial communities. Her goal once completing her undergraduate degree is to obtain a PhD in microbiology. Evelyn enjoys spending time with her family and playing with her Shih-Poo Teddy. <em>Fun fact: Evelyn's birthday is the same day as DNA day.</em>

           Joseph <em>(he/him)</em> is a junior in Biological Sciences (concentrating in microbiology) from San Juan, Puerto Rico. His research interests include anything to do with aquatic microbiology, from community assembly to horizontal gene transfer. He aims to obtain a PhD in Environmental Microbiology and to go into academia. In the lab he is studying microbial assembly in local freshwater communities around Ithaca. During his free time, he enjoys hiking, fútbol (the real one), and spending time with his friends watching TV.<em>Fun facts:  Joseph has traversed the entire length of Puerto Rico thrice on foot, and he thinks ducks are underappreciated.</em>

           Gus <em>(he/him)</em> is a first-year graduate student studying microbiology. He was raised in Wisconsin and received his degree in microbiology from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He then received a master’s in geography from the University of Galway. He has worked in diverse research projects including bacterial physiology, seaweed policy, and pathogenic gene regulation. In grad school, Gus plans to expand his skills as a bioinformatician while studying interactions within complex microbial communities. In his free time, Gus enjoys baking pies, Nordic skiing, and doing pretty much anything that’s outside.
