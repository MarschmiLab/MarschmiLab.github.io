           <strong>Teaching:</strong> BIOMI6300: Computational Approaches for Microbial Systems, taught in the Spring Semesters <br>
           Marian or Mar <em>(they/them)</em> grew up on Lake St. Clair, the lake that connects Lake Huron to Lake Erie, where they developed a curiosity of aquatic ecosystems from ponds to the Great Lakes. After attending Hampshire college, where they surprisingly designed a "major" in environmental microbiology, they fell in love with the world's tiniest organisms: bacteria. Marian's research interests are in microbial community ecology, evolution, genomics, limnology and bioinformatics with a special focus on how microhabitats structure the ecology of freshwater microbes. They identify as queer, non-binary, and polyamorous. In their spare time, they like to run far on the "gorges" trails of Ithaca, bake sweet treats (especially granola), and spend time with the Lab dog, Walli. Fun fact: Marian once swam from Asia to Europe across the Bosphorus above thousands of jellyfish and their mom!<br>

           Evie <em>(she/her)</em> is a Postdoctoral Associate at the New York State Water Resources Institute working in collaboration with the Schmidt Aquatic Microbiology Lab. She grew up on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain, where she first became interested in freshwater ecosystems. After attending St. Lawrence University for her B.S and then Clarkson University for her M.S. and PhD studying mercury mobilization along the Upper St. Lawrence River, she developed a fascination with much larger lakes, the Great Lakes. Evie considers herself a contaminant ecologist, with research interests in contaminants (esp. mercury), the Great Lakes, wetlands, limnology, and microbial ecology. In her free time, Evie likes to run, read, bake, and explore outdoors

           Joseph <em>(he/him)</em> is a junior in Biological Sciences (concentrating in microbiology) from San Juan, Puerto Rico. His research interests include anything to do with aquatic microbiology, from community assembly to horizontal gene transfer. He aims to obtain a PhD in Environmental Microbiology and to go into academia. In the lab he is studying microbial assembly in local freshwater communities around Ithaca. During his free time, he enjoys hiking, fútbol (the real one), and spending time with his friends watching TV.<em>Fun facts:  Joseph has traversed the entire length of Puerto Rico thrice on foot, and he thinks ducks are underappreciated.</em>

           Gus <em>(he/him)</em> is a second-year graduate student studying microbiology. He was raised in Wisconsin and received his degree in microbiology from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He then received a master’s in geography from the University of Galway. He has worked in diverse research projects including bacterial physiology, seaweed policy, and pathogenic gene regulation. In grad school, Gus plans to expand his skills as a bioinformatician while studying interactions within complex microbial communities. In his free time, Gus enjoys baking pies, Nordic skiing, and doing pretty much anything that’s outside.

           Sophia <em>(she/her)</em> is the laboratory technician for the Schmidt Aquatic Microbiology Lab. Growing up in Montana, her love for hiking and cross-country skiing translated into a passion for studying and conserving the natural world. She received her undergraduate degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University, where she completed her senior thesis on factors influencing open habitat vegetation in Yellowstone National Park. She became interested in aquatic ecosystems while working at the Flathead Lake Biological Station, and is interested in studying evolution and microbial interactions. During her free time, she enjoys reading, live music, the great outdoors, and spending time with her friends!
