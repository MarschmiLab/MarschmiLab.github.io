           Marian <em>(they/them)</em> grew up on Lake St. Clair, the lake that connects Lake Huron to Lake Erie, where they developed a curiosity of aquatic ecosystems and the Great Lakes. After attending Hampshire college, where they surprisingly designed a "major" in environmental microbiology, they fell in love with the world's tiniest organisms: bacteria. Marian's research interests are in microbial ecology, evolution, genomics, limnology and bioinformatics. In their spare time, they like to run far on the "gorges" trails of Ithaca, bake sweet treats (especially granola), and spend time with the Lab dog, Walli. Marian once swam from Asia to Europe across the Bosphorus above thousands of jellyfish!<br>

           Gabriela <em>(she/her/ella)</em> was born and raised in Puerto Rico. As a latina in STEM, she is a rising senior pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Microbiology in the University of Puerto Rico, Humacao Campus. Gabriela holds a great interest in bacterial interactions, pathogenic bacteria, and microbial community assembly. In the lab, Gabriela is working on how oyster farming influences marine sediment bacterial communities and their biogeochemistry. Her dream is to venture into the medical field, hoping to become a neonatologist or a medical microbiologist! In her spare time, Gabriela enjoys cooking for her friends and family. A Gaby fun fact: her favorite animal is a manatee!<br>

           Michael <em>(he/him)</em> is a rising junior in Biometry & Statistics from the outskirts of Philadelphia. His research interests are broad and include bioinformatics, microbiology, genomics, oncology, epidemiology, and anatomy. Behind all these interests is his aspiration for a career in bioinformatics. In the lab, Michael is using his coding skills to search for mobile genetic elements in freshwater bacterial communities. Outside of work, Michael likes going on long runs throughout Ithaca, dabbling in drink recipes, and playing the saxophone for the Big Red Marching Band. He is a huge fan of reality TV cooking shows such as <em>Kitchen Nightmares</em> and <em>Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.</em><br>
