           Marian or Mar <em>(they/them)</em> grew up on Lake St. Clair, the lake that connects Lake Huron to Lake Erie, where they developed a curiosity of aquatic ecosystems and the Great Lakes. After attending Hampshire college, where they surprisingly designed a "major" in environmental microbiology, they fell in love with the world's tiniest organisms: bacteria. Marian's research interests are in microbial ecology, evolution, genomics, limnology and bioinformatics. In their spare time, they like to run far on the "gorges" trails of Ithaca, bake sweet treats (especially granola), and spend time with the Lab dog, Walli. Marian once swam from Asia to Europe across the Bosphorus above thousands of jellyfish and their mom!<br>

           Evie <em>(she/her)</em> is a Postdoctoral Associate at the New York State Water Resources Institute working in collaboration with the Schmidt Aquatic Microbiology Lab. She grew up on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain, where she first became interested in freshwater ecosystems. After attending St. Lawrence University for her B.S and then Clarkson University for her M.S. and PhD studying mercury mobilization along the Upper St. Lawrence River, she developed a fascination with much larger lakes, the Great Lakes. Evie considers herself a contaminant ecologist, with research interests in contaminants (esp. mercury), the Great Lakes, wetlands, limnology, and microbial ecology. In her free time, Evie likes to run, read, bake, and explore outdoors

           Brandon <em>(he/him)</em> is a first-year graduate student studying Microbiology. He is a California local and graduated from the University of California, Davis in Microbiology. He worked in a developmental biology lab for three years, studying <em>Hydra vulgaris</em> to understand the fundamentals of nervous system development. His interest in Microbiology emerged from the impacts that microbes had on his research (contaminated Hydra plates) and the world around him (pandemics). He aims to study the microbial world around us in hopes of finding ways to use their biological potential to solve real-world issues. He aims to start a lab of his own to mentor aspiring scientists and lead his curiosity. He likes to play tennis and brew kombucha in his free time.
